	And what do Garrett McNamara,<div id="SpacialStyle"> Laird Hamilton, Shane Dorian, Mark Foo, Grant Baker,</div> Eddie Aikau, Jeff Clark, Ross Clarke-Jones, Mike Parsons, Greg Long, Ken Bradshaw, and Maya Gabeira have in common?

	Big wave surfing is nearly a sport within itself. It is addictive and creates adrenaline junkies.

	Let's put things in perspective.

	In a 15-second swell period scenario, a 50-foot wave (15 meters) carries about 1.7 MW of power across each meter of a wavefront.

	As a result, surfing huge waves can be a death sentence for those without the knowledge, physical and mental training, and experience in extreme spots and adverse weather conditions.
